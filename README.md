# Python Optimization with Cython

Welcome to this repository dedicated to demonstrating and explaining how to optimize Python code using Cython.

## Overview

This repository contains both code examples and an in-depth article detailing the process and benefits of using Cython to optimize Python code. Cython is a powerful tool that enables Python code to run at speeds near that of C, and this repository aims to showcase practical examples and best practices.

## Contents

- **Code Examples**: You'll find Python scripts alongside their optimized Cython counterparts. These examples cover a range of scenarios from simple computations to more complex algorithms.
- **Article**: The `article` contains a comprehensive guide titled "Optimizing Python Code with Cython." This article covers the fundamentals of Cython, step-by-step instructions on getting started, and advanced techniques for maximizing performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Cython installed. See our article for a guide on setting up Cython.
3. Explore the code examples and try running them to see the performance differences.
4. Read the article for a deeper understanding of how and why these optimizations work.
5. You can read the article here.
